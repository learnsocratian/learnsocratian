    <section>
      <p>LearnSocratian was born from a simple but powerful idea: that math can be taught in a way that’s engaging, clear, and truly transformational. Inspired by the Socratic method, we believe learning is best achieved through thoughtful questions, curiosity, and self-discovery.</p>

      <p>Here, we break down complex math topics into digestible, step-by-step lessons. No jargon. No intimidation. Just pure understanding — one question at a time.</p>
