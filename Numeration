    <p>Imagine math as a magnificent house. Tall, complex, full of rooms and staircases. But what holds it all up? The foundation. That’s numeration.</p>

    <p>Many students think this is math—counting, number lines, place value drills. And yeah… it can feel repetitive. Even boring.</p>

    <p>But think of a legendary basketball player. Before the crowds, they spent hours dribbling, thousands of shots, tons of misses… and kept going.</p>

[Scene 4 – Back to the classroom, same student solving advanced math] 
Narrator: 
“Numeration is the dribbling of mathematics. It’s what builds fluency, confidence, and intuition.”

[Scene 5 – House complete, child stands in front proudly] 
Narrator: 
“Without it, the rest of math can't stand. But with it? You can build towers of logic, spiral through calculus, and leap into discovery.”

[Final scene – upbeat music, text on screen: “Build Strong. Think Big.”] 
Narrator: 
“So next time you count… repeat… and drill—remember: you’re laying bricks. You’re training for greatness. One number at a time.”
